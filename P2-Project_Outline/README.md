## Submission Instructions

### Overview

My project will be a lost and found website that will allow users to search through a listing of lost and animals within an area near them. It will also allow users to create a listing if they have lost or found a pet and be able to post information about the animal. Users will also be able to search for nearby animal shelters, read other posts and see animals to foster. 

This project was inspired by the need of a website to help lost and found pets to be reunited with their owners.
